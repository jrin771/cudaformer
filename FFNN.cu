//cuda code for my feedforward neural network  
//literally just use this: https://luniak.io/cuda-neural-network-implementation-part-1/#programming-model (LMAO) 
//but I can modify it to be like the cross entropy for language modeling stuff anyways.  

//also I think I could make it like one kernel or one file and such and that could be much more useful and FUN anyways for all of this.
