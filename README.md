# CUDAFORMER 
implementing the transformer architecture (and eventually many more modern AI concepts) on a CUDA kernel.  

Inspired by James Lin, check out his work here: https://github.com/linjames0/Transformer-CUDA/tree/main

Hmm, I'm not sure the world needs another cudaformer. what are other more relevant systems stuff I could go into?
