# CUDAFORMER 
implementing the transformer architecture (and eventually many more modern AI concepts) on a CUDA kernel.  

Inspired by James Lin, check out his work here: https://github.com/linjames0/Transformer-CUDA/tree/main 

main AI concepts: Transformer, Flash-Attention, Some Kind of Triton Implementations (need to look up AWS tutorial for that)
